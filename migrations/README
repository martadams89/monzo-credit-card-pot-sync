# Database Migrations

This directory contains the database migrations for the application.

## How migrations work

Migrations are managed via Flask-Migrate (which uses Alembic). Each migration file
represents a step in the evolution of the database schema.

## Creating migrations

To create a new migration:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of migration"
```

## Running migrations

Migrations run automatically at application startup. You can also apply them manually:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

## Important files

- `env.py`: Configuration for Alembic migration environment
- `alembic.ini`: Alembic configuration file
- `script.py.mako`: Template for migration scripts
- `versions/`: Directory containing migration scripts
